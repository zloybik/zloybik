i have chance to die, like 60%, because I've got 45% blood left in my body and I won't know the result until the summer.

I write code for the project and also for my leisure time, I like to do it.

Result: Rn is not summer

If on summer(July) result is a same, its means i`m dead.

If I die, I hope this world can be changed since I couldn't.
