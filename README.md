i have chance to die, if i dont find the donor. Because I've got 45% blood left in my body and I won't know the result until the summer.

I write code for the project and also for my leisure time, I like to do it.

Result: Rn is not summer

If on summer(July) result is a same, its means i`m dead.

If I die, I hope this world can be changed since I couldn't.

Well, the main thing. If I do die. Then know, in my soul, I will be with you, I was glad to help everyone, especially ITACHI (Owner of DOTA2CLASSIC). Thank you all! I hope my death will be the most peaceful of all. Respect each other, never respond to each other with hatred, love everyone, respect everyone, save everyone, even if he is an enemy. And if so, then I want to convey my words to someone. Maybe someperson is watching and see.

For Heapy:
Go back to the classiccounter and don't trust anyone as owner. Harmy only trusted you.
Also, good luck with your university application! 

For ITACHI:
Thank you Itachi for the great attitude towards me. You were very humorous for me, it made me happy, motivated me, I want to say that you should continue the project dota2classic and not stop. You have to make it more popular than the popular! And I believe in you. Itachi. You can do it.
